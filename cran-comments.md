## Submission

Thank you for reviewing this minor patch, which addresses failures on CRAN due to changes in all.equal in r-devel per email from Prof. Ripley. 

There are no changes to worse in reverse depends. 

We have checked this in win builder and on OS X, linux, and Windows in release, oldrel, and devel on Github Actions with no issues.
