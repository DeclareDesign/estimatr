## Submission

Thank you for reviewing this minor patch, which addresses failures on CRAN due to ivpack being archived. The version is also bumped and the email address of the maintainer changed.

There are no changes to worse in reverse depends. 

We have checked this in win builder and on OS X, linux, and Windows in release, oldrel, and devel on Github Actions with no issues.
